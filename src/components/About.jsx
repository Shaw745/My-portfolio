              I combine analytical problem-solving skills with creativity to
              design and build accessible, user-friendly, and visually engaging
              web applications. My transition from environmental sciences to
              software development reflects my adaptability, curiosity, and
              commitment to continuous learning. Whether it's creating intuitive
              user interfaces or writing clean, efficient code, I enjoy turning
              ideas into functional digital solutions. Beyond coding, my
              background in biology has given me a strong sense of

              values I also bring into technology projects. I aspire to
              contribute to projects that not only solve problems but also have
              a meaningful impact. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Reactjs, Webflow and
              a bit of Designing. While I am not programming, I enjoy playing
              golf, photography and playing Valorant. Learning more to improve
              skill.
